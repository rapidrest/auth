# Release Notes

## v1.0.0

### Authentication Strategies:

* `BasicStrategy` - Simple id and password authentication
* `FIDO2Strategy` - FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware based authentication (e.g. YubiKey)
* `MFAStrategy` - Simple id and password + 2FA authentication [fido2|otp|totp]
* `OIDCStrategy` - OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect authentication
* `OTPStrategy` - One-Time Password (OTP) authentication (e.g. email, sms)
* `PasskeyStrategy` - WebAuthn based passkey authentication
* `TOTPStrategy` - RFC 6238 Time-Based One Time Password authentication (e.g. Google Authenticator, etc.)

### Data Models

This library provides variants of each of the following data models that can be used against a MongoDB or SQL database. Classes are post-fixed
with either `Mongo` or `SQL` at the end of the name (e.g. `Alias` becomes `AliasMongo` for MongoDB, `AliasSQL` for SQL).

* `User` - Describes a single user account
* `Alias` - Describes an alternate identifying name (aka: alias) for a user account (e.g. email, phone, third-party OAuth ID)
* `Secret` - Stores secrets used to authenticate user accounts (e.g. `fido2`, `passkey`, `password`, `totp` secrets)
* `Profile` - Stores additional, personally identifying, information about a user (e.g. birthdate, legal name, verified contacts, preferences)

### Route Handlers

This library provides variants of each of the following routes that can be used against a MongoDB or SQL database. Classes are post-fixed
with either `Mongo` or `SQL` at the end of the name (e.g. `BaseAliasRoute` becomes `BaseAliasRouteMongo` for MongoDB, `BaseAliasRouteSQL` for SQL).

#### Data Models

* `BaseAliasRoute` - Provides full CRUD operations for the `Alias` data model
* `BaseProfileRoute` - Provides full CRUD operations for the `Profile` data model
* `BaseSecretRoute` - Provides full CRUD operations for the `Secret` data model. Additionally includes endpoints for registration of 
`fido2`, `passkey` and `totp` secrets.
* `BaseUserRoute` - Provides full CRUD operations for the `User` data model
